;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This is my personal Emacs configuration, heavily inspired by and based upon
;; the likes of Doom, Spacemacs, and countless other configurations.
;;
;; This file is laid out in a way that is inspired by literate programming,
;; where everything resides in one file, is organised under hierachical
;; headings, and is well-commented. One day I may use Org for this, but for now
;; this is a simple way to get most of Org's benefits.
;;
;; To view the outline of this file, press the keys `z m'. To undo this by
;; unfolding everything again, press `z r' (assuming you are viewing this file
;; with Evil and Outshine loaded).
;;
;; I follow some simple conventions when writing Emacs Lisp, which are
;; documented in conventions.org.

;; And here is my personal information:
(setq-default user-full-name "Severen Redwood"
              user-mail-address "severen@shrike.me")
;; Please change the above if you are copying this file.

;;;; A Note to Prospective Users

;; There is no guarantee that this will work on any systems other than my own,
;; nor am I interested in changing this.
;;
;; If you do like my configuration, I recommend that rather than copying it in
;; full, you read through it and adapt the parts that you may find useful into
;; your own configuration. After all, that is part of what makes Emacs fun, or
;; at least according to me.
;;
;; However, if you have found an error or mistake, or believe you have something
;; to add that I may find useful, you can submit a pull request to my dotfiles
;; repository on GitHub (severen/dotfiles).
