## Installation

This is a manual step currently.

1. Set up Python 3.4+ on the system.
2. Create a virtual environment for housing dotfiles-related dependencies and
   activate it.
3. Run `python manage sync` to create the required symlinks.
4. (WIP) Run `python manage check` to see what more needs to be done to fully
   configure the system.

## Customization

You can do customization using `.local` files:

- `~/.gitconfig.local`
  - This is sourced before any other files from this folder.
- `~/.zshrc.local`
  - This is sourced before any other files from this folder.

These `.local` files can be used to add a few personal stuff without the need
to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you donâ€™t want to commit to
a public repository.

Make sure you create a `~/.gitconfig.local` for storing your credentials. Here's a template, if you're feeling lazy (replace everything in `{}` including the braces) :

```ini
[user]
    email = {your-email-id@example.com}
    name = {Your Name}

# Pro-tip: This makes working with sub-modules easier.
[url "git@github.com:{your-github-username-here}/"]
    insteadOf = "git://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/"
```

As things currently stand, these 2 files can modify nearly everything.
