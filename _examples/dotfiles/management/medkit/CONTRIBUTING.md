# Contributing
Contributions are welcome!

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/LeadPipeSoftware/medikit/fork>)
2. Create your feature or bug branch (`git checkout -b feature/foobar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some foobar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/foobar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

**Before spending lots of time on something, please ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search through the existing issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

## Non-Code Contributions
This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Code Style
Fortunately, with golang there are fewer style arguments. Run [`gofmt`][gofmt-url] and you'll probably be fine.
Otherwise, please have a look at Google's own [`Code Review Comments`][code-review-comments-url] to get a good idea of
the kinds of things reviewers will be looking at.
